            A Deterministic Compact (CBOR) Encoding for SPDX
                         draft-chamayou-cospdx

Abstract

   This document proposes a canonical serialization of SPDX 3.0.1 to
   CBOR, to enable the reproducible and efficient creation of System
   Package Data Exchange information.  This representation is consistent
   with, and lends itself to being used with transparency services
   proposed by the Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust
   initiative.

1.  Introduction

   The System Package Data Exchange specification defines an open start
   for communicating bill of materials information for different topic
   areas, and multiple serialization formats to encode that data model.

   Defined serialization formats for [SPDX] 3.0.1 are text-based and so
   tend to produce large payloads even for documents that describe a
   relatively small number of artifacts.  A JSON canonical
   serialisation, using RFC8259, is defined in SPDX 3.0.1, but is
   unevenly available because not many JSON libraries implement
   [RFC8259].

   This document follows the approach defined in [CBOR-LD], and aims to
   contribute CDDL schemas for the various SPDX profiles that describe
   how to emit CBOR-encoded SPDX 3.0.1 directly.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
