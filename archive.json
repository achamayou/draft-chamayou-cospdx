The current mapping uses the order of appearance in the json schema.\n\n- [x] Const strings to integers\n\nThere are 337 string const values defined in the spec, they are allocated from 1001 onwards.\n\n- [x] Enum strings to integers\n\nThere are 303 string enum values defined in the spec, they are allocated from 2001 onwards.\n\n- [x] hashValue is a string in JSON LD, and typically hex-encoded although the spec is not precise (https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/model/Core/Properties/hashValue/). A bstr would be more efficient in terms of space and processing, with Tag 108 to convey that it is expected to be represented as a lower-case hex string.\n\n- [x] Datetime to CBOR datetime, Epoch-based/tag1: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-epoch-based-date-time\n\n- [x] *Version are SemVer 2.0 strings. They stay as strings because CoSWID would only make them larger.\n\n- [ ] Regular expressions, need specific translation in cases where they remain (i.e. not DateTimes).",
